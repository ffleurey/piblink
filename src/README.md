This is the smallest Blink example I could find for the Pi.

It comes from https://github.com/Pieter-Jan/PJ_RPI and is explained here http://www.pieter-jan.com/node/15

To compile the code for the Pi you have either to be on a Pi with build tools installed and to use a cross-compiler.

The easiest when it come to cross compiling is to use this Docker image:
